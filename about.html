          <p>
            A cocktail is an alcoholic mixed drink, which is either a
            combination of spirits, or one or more spirits mixed with other
            ingredients such as fruit juice, flavored syrup, or cream. There are
            various types of cocktails, based on the number and kind of
            ingredients added.

          <h1>The Golden Age of Cocktails</h1>
          <p>
            There was a time, basically up through the 1970s, when a good many
            homes had their own mini bars, and cocktails were regularly served
            each evening. Cocktails were a part of life and a part of the
            culture. However, the home bar nearly became extinct as media focus
            shed a brighter light on the dangers of alcohol abuse. Make no
            mistake, there's a big difference between alcohol abuse and
            responsible drinking. It is possible to enjoy a cocktail or two
            without going overboard, but everyone must realize their limit and
            stick to it.

            <h1>ART!</h1>
            <p>
              Cocktails are a form of art, one of the greatest expressions of
              human creativity applied to the world of spirits, liquors and
              juices.
